# Chicken Biriyani
Succulent, juicy pieces of chicken are cooked in a yogurt marinade and then layered with crispy onions, coriander, mint and basmati rice to give you a dish that the entire family will enjoy. Iâ€™ve broken the process step by step and made a repository for this chicken biryani so that you can make this restaurant style biryani at home!
